---

The landscape of web development is changing rapidly. With the advent of AI tools, many are asking: *Is the role of the developer dead?*

### The Argument for AI

AI can generate code faster than any human. It knows every library and every API documentation.

* It doesn't get tired.
* It spots bugs instantly.
* It can refactor legacy code in seconds.

### The Argument for Humans

However, building software is not just about writing code. It's about:

- **Understanding value**: What problems are we solving?
- **Architecture**: How do systems fit together?
- **Empathy**: Building interfaces that humans actually enjoy using.

### Conclusion

The future isn't AI *or* Humans. It's AI *plus* Humans.

> "AI won't replace developers. Developers using AI will replace developers who don't."

If you want to stay ahead, start integrating these tools into your workflow today.
